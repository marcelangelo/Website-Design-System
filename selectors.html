                <p>
                    In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web 
                    pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS 
                    selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when 
                    selecting elements to style. In this article and its sub-articles 
                    we'll run through the different types in great detail, seeing how 
                    they work.

                                <p>
                                    A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is 
                                    a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the 
                                    browser which HTML elements should be selected to have 
                                    the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. 
                                    The element or elements which are selected by the selector 
                                    are referred to as the subject of the selector.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In other articles you may have met some different selectors,
                                    and learned that there are selectors that target the 
                                    document in different ways â€” for example by selecting an 
                                    element such as h1, or a class such as .special. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    In CSS, selectors are defined in the CSS Selectors 
                                    specification; like any other part of CSS they need to have support in 
                                    browsers for them to work. The majority of selectors that you 
                                    will come across are defined in the Level 3 Selectors 
                                    specification and Level 4 Selectors specification, which 
                                    are both mature specifications, therefore you will find 
                                    excellent browser support for these selectors.

            <!--selectors_list-->

            <div class="selectors_list">
                <h2>Selector list:</h2>

                <p>If you have more than one thing which uses the same CSS then 
                    the individual selectors can be combined into a selector list 
                    so that the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors. 
                    For example, if I have the same CSS for an h1 and also a class 
                    of .special, I could write this as two separate rules.
                </p>

                <div class="selectors_code">
                    <span>h1 &#123</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>color&#58 blue&#59</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>&#125</span> 
                    <br><br>
                    <span>.special &#123</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>color&#58 blue&#59</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>&#125</span> 
                </div>

                <p>
                    I could also combine these into a selector list, 
                    by adding a comma between them.
                </p>

                <div class="selectors_code">
                    <span>h1, .special &#123</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>color&#58 blue&#59</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>&#125</span>  
                </div>

                <p>
                    White space is valid before or after the comma. You 
                    may also find the selectors more readable if each is on a new line.
                </p>

                <div class="selectors_code">
                    <span>h1,</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>.special &#123</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>color&#58 blue&#59</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>&#125</span>  
                </div>

                <p>
                    When you group selectors in this way, if any selector is syntactically
                    invalid, the whole rule will be ignored.
                    <br><br>
                    In the following example, the
                    invalid class selector rule will be ignored, whereas the h1 would still be styled.
                </p>

                <div class="selectors_code">
                    <span>h1 &#123</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>color&#58 blue&#59</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>&#125</span> 
                    <br><br>
                    <span>..special &#123</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>color&#58 blue&#59</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>&#125</span> 
                </div>

                <p>
                    When combined however, neither the h1 nor the class will be styled
                     as the entire rule is deemed invalid.
                </p>

                <div class="selectors_code">
                    <span>h1,</span>
                    <span>..special &#123</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>color&#58 blue&#59</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>&#125</span>

                <p>
                    There are a few different groupings of selectors, and knowing which 
                    type of selector you might need will help you to find the right tool
                    for the job. In this article's subarticles we will look at the different
                    groups of selectors in more detail.

                <p>
                    Type selectors target an HTML element such as an  &#60<a style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">h1</a>&#62&#58

                <p>
                    Class selectors target an element that has a specific value for its <a style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">class</a> attribute&#58
